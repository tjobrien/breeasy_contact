		<h2>What is a Sub-Affiliate or Sales Rep?</h2>
		<p>A Sub-Affiliate is a Standard Breeasy Affiliate that reports to a Master Affiliate.  In this case, your Master Affiliate would be <%= @affiliate.affiliate_detail.company  %>.
		 A sub-affiliate is generally a small business or website that referrers Breeasy through the internet, email, newsletters, etc.</p>	    
		<p>Similar to a Sub-Affiliate, A Sales Representative reports to a Master Affiliate and can earn commissions selling Breeasy subscriptions. Unlike a sub-affiliate, a Sales Rep uses traditional marketing such as conferences, meetups, and other direct sales methods to sell Breeasy apps to all types of small businesses.</p>
		<p>As with any affiliate or commissioned sales program, there are conditions that you should read carefully.</p>
