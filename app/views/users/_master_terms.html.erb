<h2>Breeasy Master Affiliate Terms</h2>
All Pricing is set by Breeasy.com.  Breeasy will, from time to time, run specials, promos, etc. as well as offer discounts as an incentive.  Commissions paid are on these discounted prices, when
applicable.<br>
Payments made every 15th of the month with a minimum of $10.00.<br>
Affiliates are expected to maintain a commission earnings of $100.00 per month, after 3 months of joining the program.  Affiliates that perform below this minimum
may be cancelled from the program with 30 days notice at the discretion of Breeasy.com management.<br>
For each new paid annual subscription, each master affiliate can earn up to 50% commission and up to 40% commission on annual renewals and monthly subscriptions.  Commission rates vary by plan. Commissions are earned and are payable to the affiliate when the 
subscription is paid by the subscriber.  In the case that a subscription is cancelled, any commissions previously paid on new or renewal and annual subscriptions
are pro-rated and credited against future payments.<br>
Master Affiliates earn 15% of all sub-affiliates, and there is no limit to the number of sub-affiliates a Master affiliate can have.  Sub-affiliates agree to the same terms as Breeasy Standard Affiliates.  The Standard Affiliate terms are shown for your reference.<br>
The Breeasy Master Affiliate costs USD $995.00 per year.  An Invoice will be sent to the email address associated with the Affiliate User.  At times, Breeasy may offer promotions on the Breeasy Master Affiliate annual membership fee.

To reduce fraud, affiliates that have a subscriber cancellation rate higher than 10% will result in cancellation of the affiliate program and commission payments will be suspended.<br>
In certain cases, refunds for cancelled subscriptions will be pro-rated and the any commission paid will be deducted from any refund amount.<br>
Commissions rates are subject to change and can be viewed on your dashboard.  Your dashboard is available once you complete your user details.<br>
